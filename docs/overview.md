## Type Transformation Mapping

While extracting data from your data source using Fivetran, SingleStore matches Fivetran data types to SingleStore data types. If a data type isn't supported, it is automatically typecast to the closest supported SingleStore data type.

The following table illustrates how Fivetran data types are transformed into SingleStore supported types:

| Fivetran Data Type | SingleStore Data Type      |
|--------------------|----------------------------|
| BOOLEAN            | BOOLEAN                    |
| SHORT              | SMALLINT                   |
| INT                | INT                        |
| LONG               | BIGINT                     |
| BIGDECIMAL         | DECIMAL                    |
| FLOAT              | FLOAT                      |
| DOUBLE             | DOUBLE                     |
| LOCALDATE          | DATE                       |
| LOCALDATETIME      | DATETIME(6)                |
| INSTANT            | DATETIME(6)                |
| STRING             | TEXT                       |
| XML                | TEXT                       |
| JSON               | JSON                       |
| BINARY             | BLOB                       |

## Schema Changes

| Schema Change          | Supported | Notes                                                                                                     |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Add column             | ✔       | When Fivetran detects the addition of a column in your source, it automatically adds that column in the SingleStore destination. |
| Change column type     | ✔       | When Fivetran detects a change in the column type in the data source, it automatically changes the column type in the SingleStore destination. To change the column type, Fivetran creates a new column, copies the data from the existing column to the new column, deletes the existing column, and renames the new column. |
| Change key             | ✘      | Changing PRIMARY KEY is not supported in SingleStore. |
| Change key column type | ✘      | Changing PRIMARY KEY column data type is not supported in SingleStore. |
